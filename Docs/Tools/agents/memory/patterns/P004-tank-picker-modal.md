P004 | 2026-02-08 | Impact: MEDIUM | Status: ACTIVE | Domain: ui

**Summary:** Reusable pattern for "Add to Tank" flows from species/equipment/etc.

**Details:** Load user tanks, filter by compatibility (freshwater/saltwater), show selection UI. Auto-redirect to single tank if only one exists. Use for any feature that needs "which tank?" selection.

**Action:** Reuse this pattern for equipment tracking, photo diagnosis, and any "add to tank" flow.
